He also wants to require independent audits of major utility contracts.\nBailey said he would cap annual property tax rates to not exceed a person’s mortgage rate.  In response, he said the state would do more to fund education but did not elaborate on how much he would increase spending for public schools to help them rely less on property taxes.",

Don't feel embarrassed. Many people make health resolutions at the beginning of the year but can't seem to stick to them. If you want to get serious about your wellness journey in 2026 and quit quitting, start with these simple tips from Dr. Kumkum Patel, M.D., board-certified gastroenterologist and gut health expert.\nBuild consistency, not perfection\nMost people quit wellness routines because they aim for extremes such as cutting out entire food groups, overhauling schedules or expecting immediate results. Patel emphasizes that sustainable health comes from small, repeatable habits, including eating regular meals, prioritizing sleep and supporting digestion daily. When you create a realistic routine, you're far more likely to stick with it long-term.\nIncorporate\ndaily movement\nSpeaking of consistent routine, establishing daily physical activity is a cornerstone of lifelong, holistic health. That said, committing to hitting the gym every day isn't realistic or sustainable. When you can't meet this unattainable goal, you may feel discouraged and give up physical activity altogether.\nInstead of forcing yourself to try exercises that you dread and want to put off, aim for moving your body in ways that make you feel good and bring you joy. Go on a daily walking meditation, practice yoga, break out your bike or dance around your living room. The goal isn't to achieve lofty benchmarks, but to consistently move your body to enhance your mood and overall wellness.\nStay hydrated\nStaying hydrated helps your body function at its best. In fact,\ncan help you regulate your body temperature, improve sleep quality, boost brain performance, ensure your organs function properly and lift your mood. It's a simple but essential habit to incorporate into your wellness routine in the new year, especially given the dry winter air.\nSupport your gut daily\n,\neven when life gets busy\nDigestive health plays a central role in energy, immunity and your overall well-being. Patel notes that when digestion is supported, people often notice better energy, mood and resilience, which reinforces motivation and helps prevent quitting altogether. However, gut health is often the first thing people abandon when their routines are disrupted.\nYou can make your gut health easier to maintain with a daily probiotic like\n. This wellness product supports digestive and immune health and doesn't require refrigeration. It's a simple, reliable tool that can help you stay consistent even during travel, stress or schedule changes.\nMaintain a consistent sleep schedule\nGood quality sleep lets you recharge body and mind, so you can face the next day with focus and energy. When you get enough sleep, you may also find that sticking to your new routines and habits is easier. To set yourself up for slumber success, make sure you go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. Yes, even on weekends.\nListen to your body instead of chasing trends\nFollowing conflicting social media advice often leads to wellness fatigue. Instead of jumping from trend to trend, Patel recommends paying attention to how your body responds. If a wellness habit or routine makes you feel worse, stop. If you need guidance to improve your health and wellness, check with your doctor instead of the internet.\nYour wellness is a journey, not a destination. By incorporating these expert tips, you can invest in your wellness and create habits that will help you in the new year and beyond.
