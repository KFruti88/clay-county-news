        "full_story": "It’s now possible to earn a four-year degree in agriculture without leaving the area.\nKaskaskia College and Southern Illinois University at Carbondale have entered into a new partnership designed to expand access to affordable, high-quality agricultural bachelor’s degree options.\nAt the signing ceremony Tuesday at the John Cavaletto Agriculture building, Kaskaskia College President George Evans thanked SIU for joining them in thinking outside the box.\n“It’s a great opportunity for our students,” Evans said.  “For individuals to come to this institution, learn from our faculty and achieve an associate’s degree in agriculture or agronomy and transfer to SIU, which is a level one research facility, one of three in the state of Illinois, and not have to leave the region.  To attend courses here and earn their transcript under the flagship of SIU, under the tutelage of SIU leaders and faculty. It’s the evolution of higher education.”\nSIU Chancellor Austin Lane says this partnership demonstrates what is possible when institutions work together with a shared commitment to student success and regional growth.\n“The program will be seamless,” Lane said.  “The facilities that are here at Kaskaskia are second to none.  When you think about pairing our faculty with the faculty that’s here and the amount of intellect and knowledge around agriculture, it’s going to be a game changer for our students.”\nThe Dean of SIU’s College of Agricultural, Life, and Physical Sciences Kristina Boone says there is a shortage to fill current openings.\n“The number one issue in the agricultural industry right now is workforce and the lack of workforce,” Boone said.  “This is something that’s really important for us to be able to do, is develop our workforce in agriculture.  This innovative partnership really allows us to do that in an accessible and affordable way that also provides an excellent education.”\nEvans see potential for Kaskaskia College being involved in similar programs in other fields.\n“I hope we’re back here every year offering 25 different options, because in my mind… this is an absolute no brainer,” Evans said.  “We want to keep students in Illinois, we want to keep students attending our universities, going back to raise their families and staying in the region.”\nThe initial bachelor’s degree programs will be in Agribusiness Economics and Agricultural Systems and Education.\nUnder the program, some SIU professors will travel to Kaskaskia for coursework, while some will be delivered online.\nStudents interested in learning more or applying for one of the available agricultural bachelor’s degree pathways, may contact\n.",

While hundreds of small earthquakes occur each year in the US, the worst in Illinois history occurred on December 17\nth\n, 1811, and was so strong that it rang a church bell in a Cairo church in southern Illinois.  It also blew smoke, sand, and coal 30 yards into the air and made the Mississippi River flow backward for a moment.\nIllinois rests between the New Madrid Seismic Zone and the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone.  If you feel an earthquake or receive an alert about an earthquake, you are encouraged to “Drop, Cover, and Hold On.”  Sheltering on the floor under heavy furniture, protecting your head, and stabilizing yourself by holding onto furniture is your best chance to stay safe.  Persons using walkers or wheelchairs are advised to lock down and then cover and hold on.\nIEMA-OHS also recognizes the national ShakeOut drill in October and encourages all residents to join in practicing the “Drop, Cover, and Hold On” earthquake response.\nDisaster preparedness information is ready available from IEMA-OHS on the Ready Illinois website, a one-stop resource for detailed information about what to do before, during, and after disasters.",

        "full_story": "Flora High School Junior Gage Dugan is being honored by the IHSA.\nDiagnosed with bone cancer throughout his lower legs as a child, Gage spent much of his earliest years in and out of hospitals, enduring treatment, remission, and then a second battle with cancer that lasted from ages four through eight.  Along the way, he was also diagnosed with a rare autoimmune condition that required ongoing medical care, including shots that are intended to essentially replace his immune system.\nGage caught the attention of the state this fall when he performed an incredible act of kindness for another high school student in a similar situation.  When the Wolves were slated to face Maroa-Forsyth High School in the Quarterfinal round of the IHSA Class 2A Football Playoffs in mid-November.  That week, Gage’s mom saw a Facebook post about a Maroa-Forsyth student who was battling leukemia.  Gage and his mom put together a care basket for the young man, Matthew Clary.  The basket included simple things like the game Uno, a deck of cards, coloring books, a blanket, and socks, things that Gage remembered enjoying during his own treatments.\nClary serves as the Maroa-Forsyth school mascot during games, while his older brother Michael was on the gridiron facing off against Dugan.  Flora ultimately lost the football game, but despite the outcome, Gage collected himself post-game to go present the basket, talk, encourage, and pray with Clary and his family.  As word spread of Gage’s selfless act, other schools pitched in as well.  Wilmington High School, who eventually faced Maroa-Forsyth in the state championship, collected over $1,000 for the Clary family.\nGage’s mission to give back is not limited to a single day or student.  He has fully embraced the concept through helping organize canned food drives, community events, and participating in service-based initiatives such as a “Paint a Game” fundraiser conducted in conjunction with a regular-season Flora football game this year.\nDugan’s journey is a powerful reminder that the true spirit of sport extends far beyond competition.  Through resilience, compassion, and an unwavering commitment to serving others, Gage has transformed personal adversity into a force for good, making him a truly deserving recipient of the NFHS Spirit of Sport Award.",

Vernon Outland Airport,” said Chris Collins, Airport Manager.  “This event puts our airport on a national stage and highlights the professionalism of our facilities and staff.  It’s exciting to host an event of this scale and significance.”\nRacers and race officials are expected to begin arriving on Thursday, June 25\nth\n, and will remain in Mt. Vernon through Monday, June 29\nth\n, participating in a variety of planned events, receptions, educational opportunities, and community activities throughout their stay.\n“This is truly a community-wide opportunity,” said Sheila Jolly Scrivner, Host City Terminus Chair.  “From aviation enthusiasts to families and local businesses, the Air Race Classic offers something for everyone, and we’re looking forward to showcasing Mt. Vernon’s hospitality and support for women in aviation.”\nA public aviation celebration and youth activity day will be held on Saturday, June 27\nth\n, from 9 am to 3 pm at Mt. Vernon Outland Airport.  Activities will include Young Eagle Flights for children, interactive aviation displays, educational opportunities, and additional family-friendly programming designed to inspire the next generation of pilots and aviation professionals.\nEvent organizers are actively seeking local, regional, and national sponsors to support the 2026 Air Race Classic Terminus and related activities.  Sponsorship opportunities will offer businesses and organizations high-visibility exposure, community engagement, and alignment with a nationally respected aviation event that promotes education, skill, and opportunity for women pilots.\nThe Air Race Classic is a nonprofit organization dedicated to encouraging and educating women pilots, increasing public awareness of general aviation, and honoring the legacy of women in aviation through an annual cross-country air race.",

        "full_story": "The Louisville Village Board met Thursday night and moved quickly through their agenda.\nAs the meeting was called to order, Mayor Chris Rinehart asked and trustees approved the meeting agenda and past meeting minutes.  The first issue concerned the final pay order for the Pavillion Project.  Engineer Mike Bridges with Charleston Engineering of Olney presented the details of the request.  He recalled that Johannes Construction of Centralia removed the cracked concrete at Louisville’s new Pavillion on the courthouse square.  They replaced the damaged concrete with new materials from Flora Ready Mix, which is much closer than the original source.  Bridges indicated the new concrete has tested well and brings the OSLAD Grant program to a close.  He did note that there were two additions to the project, which increased the overall price.  He said metal trim for the roof added $4,000 to the price and two plumbing items increased the cost by $8,000.  Those items were a mop sink and a water fountain.   additions raised the cost of the final pay order to $41,889.  Some trustees bristled at the costs, but eventually the motion to approve passed on a unanimous vote.\nTrustees next voted to approve the village bills for January and then briefly discussed the need to prepare for mowing this summer for village owned property.  Utilities Superintendent Troy Elwood stated that the properties needing mowed are the same as last year.  Members then voted to advertise for bids with a winning bidder chosen at a future meeting.\nMayor Rinehart called on Village Attorney Kyle Boose to update the board on his negotiations with Ameren concerning a franchise agreement.  Boose reported that he had struck an agreement with Ameren that includes changes that benefit the village by increasing the franchise fee from $5,000 to $8,000, annually.  Another change is the contract length.  The new agreement covers an eight-year period, rather than a much longer-term deal that Ameren had sought.  Trustees approved the new agreement without dissent.  A moment later, Boose presented information about the property at 930 Vandalia Rd., which the village is seeking to be cleaned up.  Boose reports the property has liens on it from the State of Illinois and there is a mortgage on the property as well.  He told the board that he will learn more as process unfolds and he will report back to them as it progresses.\nThe mayor stated that the Village of Louisville Policy Manual is in serious need of being updated.  He volunteered his time and stated that he and Clerk Leah Wetherholt could work on the manual.  It was then pointed out that there is a committee for that work, consisting of Chuck Smith, Craig Cliftron and Mary Frazier.  Mayor Rinehart said they could all work together on and that they need to make it priority to get it updated.  He suggested using the new policy manual just released by the Illinois Counties Risk Management Trust.  He says the village can just pick and choose the items they would like to see included in the new village document.  Rinehart offered to share the existing, outdated document with the whole board and members agreed that it was a good idea.\nAfter a brief discussion about paying for a dumpster for residents use, village trustees are taking a wait and see attitude for the time being.  Members are torn between offering the Luttrell Dumpster for use by the community and seeing it filled with inappropriate materials by unknown parties.  The policy that was adopted in November will remain in place for the time being.  Residents can use the dumpster, but access is controlled by the village.  If Louisville residents need to place accepted items in the dumpster, call the village hall and talk to Utility Supt. Troy Elwood.\n‘’The final item in open session was a discussion about offering increased pay for village employees that become certified for the various licenses that are required to operate the various entities that the village is required to operate.  That includes natural gas and water as the two most important.  Promises were made to an employee about obtaining licensure and being rewarded for his effort.  Trustees will likely discuss this further at a future meeting that would cover additional village employees.\nIn open time, which followed a brief closed session where no action was taken, Mayor Rinehart thanked village workers for their great effort at snow removal during the recent storms that deposited close a foot of snow in some areas.  He said they did a great job and thanked them for hard work.  That topic led Trustee Tim Davis to ask why village sidewalks weren’t cleared following the snowfall, particularly next to Route 45.  He said he’s seen numerous people walking on the highway because the sidewalks had not been shoveled and he fears someone will be hit by the nearby passing vehicles, especially when many seem to be wearing dark clothing.  Davis was referred to Louisville Village Ordinance 672 that prohibits the village from removing snow from sidewalks.  If the village were to remove snow and someone was injured, the village would be liable.  Removing snow from sidewalks is the responsibility of the property owner.  Next, Mayor Rinehart reported that a couple had purchased the Springfield Medical Clinic building on the courthouse square and has some as yet unannounced plans for the location.\nPrior to adjourning, the board heard from Mary Murphy with Growls and Meows Veterinary Clinic in Cisne was in attendance on behalf of the Southern Illinois Critter Fixers.  The group is a non-profit organization that seeks to control the stray and feral cat population in the area.  They participate in what is referred to TNR, or Trap, Neuter and Return.  Theirs is a long-term solution to solve the cat overpopulation problem.  The village gave funds to the group in the past to help them get started.  Murphy presented a document that shows the work they’ve completed.  In Louisville, they’ve spayed or neutered 41 cats that prevents an estimated 600 cats from being born each year.  Murphy thanked the village for their contribution and thanked the other contributors from Louisville that are helping them to accomplish their mission.\nSo far, Louisville and its residents have contributed $3,335 to their cause.  To learn more about Southern Illinois Critter Fixers, call Mary Murphy at 618-599-6035.\nWith all business complete, the meeting adjourned.",

        "full_story": "Illinois is helping to ensure that all students have access to higher education with One Click College Admit Month.  Activities throughout the month are part of an ongoing campaign to increase awareness of and participation in Illinois’ new, simple and quick direct college admissions program.\nLast summer, the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE), in collaboration with the Illinois Community College Board (ICCB) and the Illinois Student Assistance Commission (ISAC), launched One Click College Admit, a statewide program offering direct admissions to participating Illinois public universities and community colleges.  Illinois high school juniors and community college transfer students who take advantage of the program receive direct college admission offers based only on their grade point average (GPA), without applications, essays, letters of recommendation, or application fees.\nSpeaking on behalf of all the Illinois education agencies, IBHE Executive Director Ginger Ostro said, “By eliminating fees and the application process for participating state universities and our community colleges, we can empower more students across the state with higher education options that put them on a path for success.  We encourage students and families to learn about the program and complete the simple opt-in process.”\nThroughout the month, ISAC will host activities in collaboration with high schools across the state and with the support of IBHE, ICCB, and the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE).\nSigning up for the One Click College Admit Program can take less than 5 minutes. In their junior year of high school, students (and parents if the student is under 18) complete a short opt-in form that allows high schools to share the student’s GPA with ISAC so it can match it to GPA criteria provided by participating colleges and universities.  Then the student creates a Common App account and simply waits to receive college admissions offers through their Common App account in September of their senior year.\nCurrent community college students who are on track to complete their associate degree and looking to transfer to an Illinois public 4-year university can also opt-in to the One Click College Admit Program to receive admission offers to universities.  ICCB is sharing resources, hosting information sessions and collaborating with community colleges to ensure students are aware of this new pathway to a free and simple transfer process.\nFor more information about the One Click College Admit Program, visit oneclickadmit.org.",

        "full_story": "Gas prices have dropped across the country in recent months, but the Illinois Fuel and Retail Association is warning that higher prices may be on the way in the Land of Lincoln.\nIllinois and five other Midwestern states opted out of a federal waiver regarding the weight of E10 gasoline, hoping the federal government would require year-round sales of E15.  Governor J.B. Pritzker renewed his call for year-round E15 sales last month, saying the fuel blend with 15% ethanol would increase demand for corn by 2 billion bushels a year.\nIllinois Fuel & Retail Association CEO Nate Harris said Illinois is stuck in the middle of a fight between the refining and ethanol industries.  “If current regulations go into effect in the summer, we’re likely to see 25 to 30 cent per gallon price increases,” Harris told The Center Square.  Harris said the IFRA supports year-round E15, but until a federal fix is enacted, Pritzker should follow Ohio’s lead by opting back into the E10 waiver.  “The governor can make that request to the U.S. EPA, and it’s our understanding that that would most likely be accepted.  That would avoid the price increases as well as the headaches for operators,” Harris said.\nHarris said the state could wait for emergency waivers instead of requesting the standard E10 waiver.  “The problem with waiting for the emergency waiver is that prices will start to increase for consumers until the waivers are issued,” Harris said.\nHarris said operators would buy lighter-waited gas during the waiting period.  “When the emergency waiver comes in, they’ll be stuck with more expensive product.  Then they’ll have to compete with states like Indiana or all the other states in the Midwest that are not opting out of this E10 waiver,” Harris said.\nThe governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Harris said if prices go up and volume goes down, tax revenues would also decrease.  At 48.3 cents per gallon, Illinois has one of the highest motor fuel taxes in the United States.\nAccording to AAA, the average per-gallon price for regular unleaded in Illinois climbed back over $3 this week to $3.035 on Friday.  The national average was $2.90.  One year ago at this time, the average Illinois price for regular unleaded was $3.26 per gallon.",

        "full_story": "Social media may be a refuge for your personal and professional networking, entertainment, and an escape from the daily grind, but it can be a dangerous and costly space for getting tax advice.\nAccording to recent IRS warnings, a growing number of fraudulent tax schemes have been circulating across social media platforms, promoting the misuse of various tax credits or deductions that most taxpayers don’t qualify for.  These scams led to thousands of taxpayers filing inaccurate or frivolous returns last year, often resulting in steep fines, including a $5,000 civil penalty.  Since 2022, the IRS has imposed more than 32,000 penalties costing taxpayers more than $162 million.\nTaxpayers should be wary of taking tax advice found on social media, particularly from unknown and unvetted sources or individuals, and it’s in their best interest to be aware of the warning signs of scams.  Fraudulent tax advice and social media tax scams often, claim everyone qualifies for certain tax credits, convince taxpayers to lie on tax forms, promise “easy” or “fast” refunds with minimal documentation needed, instruct taxpayers to file amended returns, even if they didn’t originally qualify for the credits or deductions, encourage taxpayers to ignore IRS letters or respond with false information and direct taxpayers to web links of harmful sites instead of IRS.gov.\nTaxpayers who come across suspicious social media posts like these should report them to the IRS, email them to\n, or file a complaint with the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.\nTaxpayers who believe they’ve been misled and filed an incorrect return may need to amend their tax return.  It’s also important to respond promptly to any IRS letters or notices that are received via the US Postal Service and seek out official tax resources for help at IRS.gov.\nConsulting a trusted expert is also advisable.  Many CPAs, specialize in representing taxpayers in front of the IRS.  All year long, CPAs are ready to help guide individuals through their toughest tax challenges.  The Illinois CPA Society’s free “Find a CPA” directory can help individuals find the trusted, strategic advisor that’s right for them based on location, types of services needed, and languages spoken.  Find a CPA at www.icpas.org/findacpa.",

        "full_story": "This Super Bowl weekend, the Illinois Department of Transportation, Illinois State Police and numerous local police and sheriff’s departments across the state are taking a timeout to spread two important safety messages to the public; “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over” and “Click It or Ticket.”  The Super Bowl safety campaign runs from Friday, through 6 am Monday.\nStephane B. Seck-Birhame, IDOT’s bureau chief of Safety Programs and Engineering said “Before the game begins, designate a driver or make other arrangements for a safe, sober ride so that you, your passengers and everyone on our roads can return home safely.  Driving impaired is the worst decision you can make.  It’s also 100% avoidable.”\nDrinking alcohol isn’t the only impairment risk.  Cannabis and other drugs; including prescription and over-the-counter medications; can slow reaction time, affect judgment and make driving dangerous.  Plan a sober ride home.\n“Whether you’re a Seahawks or Patriots fan, or just love football, celebrate safely this Super Bowl Sunday,” said ISP Division of Patrol Col. Chris Owen.  “If you drink, don’t drive, and make sure to buckle up, otherwise you could face a penalty flag that could cost you the game.”\nSafety should be your No. 1 priority.  When it’s time to leave the party, make sure your designated driver is sober.  Remember that walking impaired also can be dangerous, so designate a sober friend to walk home with you if needed.\nIf you’re planning on being the designated driver, while at the party, enjoy the food, the company, non-alcoholic drinks, and do not use cannabis or other impairing drugs.  Remember that sober driving isn’t the only law that should be followed.  Make sure you and everyone in the vehicle wear their seat belts.  It’s your best defense in a crash.\nThe Super Bowl safety campaign is part of the Illinois “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over” and “Click It or Ticket” programs that are funded with federal highway safety dollars administered by IDOT and coincides with the “It’s Not a Game” radio, digital and TV campaign, reminding the public of the consequences of impaired driving as well as distracted driving, work zone safety, pedestrian safety, motorcycle awareness and occupant safety.",

        "full_story": "A search warrant executed by the FBI revealed the target of a criminal probe was then Carlyle Police Chief Mark Pingsterhaus, who leased office space in the police station to a federal task force that battles public corruption in southern Illinois.\nThe FBI is investigating Pingsterhaus, a 30-year law enforcement veteran, for possible wire fraud and theft of federal funds, according to the search warrant, obtained by Capitol News Illinois and the Illinois Answers Project.  The FBI rents space in the Carlyle police station in downstate Clinton County.\nNo criminal charges have been filed against Pingsterhaus, who resigned in December, and neither the city nor the FBI would discuss the nature of the allegations.\nIn November, under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, the two news organizations requested a copy of any search warrant served on the city after a press release posted on the city’s Facebook page publicly confirmed a federal investigation into Pingsterhaus.\nCarlyle City Administrator Brad Myers initially declined multiple requests from reporters for a copy of the search warrant but eventually provided one last week more than two months later.\nUS Magistrate Judge Reona J. Daly signed the search warrant on November 12\nth\n.  It stated the FBI sought financial records from Pingsterhaus’ office at the Carlyle Police Department, including cash, receipts, ledgers and lease agreements related to expenses paid with city funds.  It further sought records of checks, credit cards, gift cards and petty cash.\nThe search warrant also sought any correspondence, gifts, keys, photographs or other items “indicating a personal relationship or travel” with a person whose name was redacted by Myers, who stated the person was a “private citizen.”  Reporters have learned she is a public official in a neighboring county.\nThe FBI requested police department expenses dating back to 2012, when Pingsterhhaus became chief, and payroll, leave information and travel authorizations and reimbursements for Pingsterhaus starting in 2024.  They also requested Pingsterhaus’ personnel record, in a subpoena dated six days after the search warrant.\nThe search warrant included a photo of Pingsterhaus’ office door at the Carlyle police station, just steps away from the home of the FBI’s Southern Illinois Transnational Organized Crime West Task Force, or TOC-W.  Pingsterhaus signed the lease with the FBI to house the task force in 2021.\nThe arrangement was mutually beneficial.  Both agencies had a similar mission; Carlyle police patrolling and investigating crimes in the Clinton County town of around 3,200, and the TOC-W Task Force focusing on international drug trafficking rings operating in southern Illinois, as well as money laundering, murder, extortion, kidnapping and public corruption.\nThe feds agreed to pay up to $180,000 renovation costs and $3,750 a month in rent to the city for space in the police station located just down the street from Carlyle Lake, a state recreation area, under the terms of the lease obtained under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act.\nThough the 12-member federal task force would have their own office secured behind a keypad, task force members and Carlyle police officers would heat up leftovers in the same microwave of a shared kitchen; pass each other going in and out of meetings of the shared conference room and use the same restrooms.\nTwo other federal agencies provide investigative assistance to the task force, including the Drug Enforcement Agency and Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.\nFor years, the local police and federal agents quietly shared the space.  Then, on November 19\nth\n, 2025, city officials received word of an ongoing FBI investigation of Pingsterhaus.  Neither Mayor Judy Smith nor city administrator Myers would discuss the nature of the investigation.\nJust 18 months before the announcement that he was the target of a federal investigation, Pingsterhaus graduated from the FBI Academy, a 10-week leadership and development course at the bureau’s headquarters in Quantico, Virginia, that emphasizes leadership, academics and physical fitness for senior law enforcement officers.\nEarlier this month, Jason Herzing, a long-time member of the FBI task force on loan from the Carlyle Police Department, was named the new police chief with a $100,000 annual salary.",

        "full_story": "For the first time in five years, certain forms of student loan forgiveness will be taxable following a change in federal tax policy this year.\nThis comes after a provision of the American Rescue Plan Act expired on December 31\nst\n.  That measure, signed into law in 2021 by former President Joe Biden, temporarily excluded student loan debt from federal income taxes.\nAnd those tax implications could extend to Illinois state taxes as well unless lawmakers act.\nPresident Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” enacted last summer, did not make the student loan tax forgiveness provision permanent.  As a result, student loans that are canceled or partially forgiven in 2026 and beyond will see taxes owed on those forgiven amounts, advocates said.  These taxes could amount to as much as $10,000, depending on the borrower’s income.\nThis includes income-driven repayment plan-related forgiveness; some closed school discharges; where 100% of a student loan obligation is wiped out if a school closes; and private settlements.\nIn addition to federal taxes, some borrowers will also face a similar tax hike at the state level.  Illinois is one of 20 states whose tax codes automatically conform to the federal change.  This means that unless Illinois legislators decouple the conforming provision before taxes are due next year, student loan forgiveness amounts will also be taxed by the state.\nLawmakers passed a bill in their fall veto session to decouple the state and federal tax code as it pertained to certain corporate taxes to head off a budget shortfall for the upcoming year.  But it did not address student borrowing.\nMeanwhile, some forms of loan forgiveness remain tax-free, such as public service loan forgiveness, teacher loan forgiveness, and death and disability discharge programs.",

        "full_story": "(2/3/26) pg\nThe Flora City Council met on Monday afternoon at City Hall and wasted little time getting down to business.  During public comments, Mayor Linda Spicer called on Don Fry with the Flora Masonic Lodge.  He was on hand to promote the Fifth Annual Shriners Hospitals for Children Auction.  The event is planned for Saturday, May 30.  Fry sought council approval to host the auction again at the Clay County Fairgrounds in Charley Brown Park.  He announced that he is still seeking donations from individuals to include in the auction and suggested items that might but unused items in a garage or closet.  He added he will soon approach local businesses for contributions to help the Shriners hit their target to raise over $20,000 this year.  Posters are going up around town to help in the effort that includes a QR Code so people can donate to Shriner’s Hospitals for Children.  Commissioners quickly approved Fry’s request.\nAs the meeting got down to business, the council quickly approved the meeting agenda and consent agenda which included past meeting minutes and the warrant list for the latter half of January.\nIn regular business, Mayor Linda Spicer expressed gratitude to city workers for two major events that occurred separately but impacted them in a big way.  First, the winter storm that deposited from 9-10 inches around Flora brought travel to a standstill and employees got after it to help remove it from city streets.  Mayor Spicer said she has heard from people from outside the area express how impressed they were with the snow removal from local roads.  Then on Thursday morning last week a water line break caused havoc for a few days while crews worked making repairs.  She added the weather was terrible.  It was cold, wet and slick and she is thankful the city has people who answer the call.  She also commented that it’s nice to live in a community where neighbors were out helping neighbors cope with the storm and its aftermath.  She closed with a reminder that it’s a new month and employees are shifting their focus to meter readings for gas, water and electricity.  She asks residents to help employees perform this duty by ensuring there is a clear path to the meters that they read including making sure fences and gates are passable.  Before moving on, the mayor also thanked the Chamber of Commerce for their event recognizing winners of their annual awards and thanked them for including the City as part of the evening.\nThe mayor then polled commissioners for their comments.  Commissioner Phil Wiley also thanked workers for their effort, day and night for the waterline repairs and for snow removal.  He said while the weather was horrible, he’s glad no one was hurt.  Wiley also reported seeing kids and adults enjoying the snow and was happy for them, but he still hopes we don’t see any more snow this year.  Commissioner Jim Fehrenbacher said that he echoed Phil Wiley’s comments but added that former residents who now live in Evansville were here and commented what a great job the city crews did in removing snow from the highways and streets and said in Evansville the side streets and residential areas are still terrible a week later.\nNext, City Administrator/Economic Development Director Mike Stanford called on Lee Beckham with Milano and Grunloh Engineers from Effingham for the latest on Flora’s grant applications.  Beckham went through the laundry list of grant opportunities including the lead service line inventory, unsewered area grant, Safe Routes to School Grant, Illinois Transportation Enhancement Program or ITEP Grant as well as grants offered by DCEO.  The grants are all in various stages of consideration, but there’s not likely to be much movement on most until May.\nStanford then presented two ordinances for council consideration.  First was to authorize the ceding of private activity bonding authority for a previous bonding issue, which commissions quickly approved.  Then, commissioners approved an ordinance  establishing a lease agreement with Flora Schools for a repeater system on the city water tower in the industrial park.  Stanford took a moment to comment on the various grant opportunities the city tries to take advantage of from the state of Illinois to help pay for major issues.  He then listed the proposed wastewater treatment plant the city seeks to try to modernize and replace its antiquated sewage treatment plant.  He expressed hope that the city will get good news on that front in the not too distant future.  Stanford also mentioned the lighting grant the city received for Rotary Park, Skate Park and Basketball Court.  He also said that the city received good news from Illinois Congressman Mike Bost.  Bost contacted the city and said Flora is the recipient of $1.34 Million for road improvement.  The grant will go to resurface Old Route 50 from GSI (now Ed Lewis Trucking) to the former Lincoln School corner and from the West Y to north on Camelia Road.\nNext, in answer to a media question about last week’s waterline break on North Main Street, Stanford explained what happened.  He stated that last Thursday morning around 6:30, he was coming to City Hall and saw water running east on 2\nnd\nStreet from State Street.  As he got to the corner, he says that Flora Police Chief Jeremy Ruger was already on site with lights flashing as the break had just occurred.  That got the ball rolling to determine what the damage was and how to fix it.  First, they had to do an emergency locate and once that was completed, they devised a plan of what to do.  They learned that it was not a single waterline break.  Instead, there were two waterlines affected.  In fact, an eight inch line intersects with a four inch line at a 4-way reducing cross, and that is what broke.  Stanford said they had to install two line stops because the valves that were meant to stop the water flow would not completely close due to their age.  The repair was complicated by the fact that there was a natural gas line in close proximity to the water line.  That meant they couldn’t use a backhoe and had to dig it out by hand.  When the area was finally exposed, Stanford reported two recent purchases were put to the test.  Namely, the new Vac Truck and the Guillotine Saw.  The latter was purchased after a serious injury occurred during a previous waterline repair on North State St.  The work continued into early Friday morning and parts had to be secured from a business in Evansville.  Crews continued working on Friday and were able to complete their task despite dangerous frigid temperatures.  The repair was completed on North Main in front of the Flora Elks and the Masonic Building and then a little later there was a smaller break on South Main and South Street, but it was repaired quickly.\nStanford said other communities have commented that they could learn lessons from what the city employees did not only with the waterline repair but also with he snow removal.  He offered thanks for their efforts during a difficult situation.  As to why the break occurred, it’s a combination of the extreme cold weather and antiquated waterlines.  Flora is not the only community affected by these problems.  It’s everywhere that endures sometimes severe winter weather.  He said people have asked why put down new road only to have to dig it up in short order.  He answered that while the lines underneath the streets are old, they have endured pretty well and if they are to be replaced it will cost much more than roads above it.  He said they recognize it is taxpayer money and they do their best to see that it’s spent in a wise fashion.\nTo bring the meeting an end, Superintendent of Public Services Toby Rinehart asked the council to approve two items.  First, was change order #2 for Sanitary Sewer Improvements, Section 1 for Kieffer Brothers Construction of Mt. Carmel, a decrease of $14,761, which was approved without dissent.  Next, the council approved payment #5 for Sanitary Sewer Improvements, Section 1 to Kieffer Brothers Construction in the amount of $258,600.  Before the meeting adjourned Mike Stanford offered kudos for Toby Rinehart and Kieffer Brothers for keeping the sewer project on budget.  He also took one more opportunity to ask residents to clear a path to their water, gas and electricity meters so city crews can take their regular month meter readings and not have to struggle through deep snow or getting through fences and gates that are blocked by ice and snow.\nWith all business complete, the meeting adjourned.",

        "full_story": "Illinois Eastern Community Colleges will launch a new generation of transfer-focused programs beginning Fall 2026, following formal approval by the IECC Board of Trustees.\nThe newly approved Transfer Pathways represent a major step forward in helping students move seamlessly from IECC to four-year universities.  Each pathway is a clearly structured, 64-credit degree plan designed to align with university requirements, reduce excess credits and provide students with a clear and intentional route to a bachelor’s degree.\nRather than asking students to piece together courses on their own, IECC faculty and staff have mapped semester-by-semester degree plans that connect directly to specific majors at Illinois universities and other regional partners.  Students will know from day one what courses to take, when to take them and how they apply toward the bachelor’s degree they want to pursue.\n“We’ve built a strong reputation in career and technical education by offering programs that are clear, purposeful and connected to outcomes,” said Dr. Cathy Robb, IECC Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs.  “Transfer Pathways applies that same philosophy to university-bound students.  By naming programs by major and aligning them directly to bachelor’s degrees, we are elevating the visibility of transfer options and establishing IECC as a leader in transfer success.”\nBeginning Fall 2026, IECC students will be able to enroll in newly structured transfer degrees across a wide range of disciplines.  Each pathway includes carefully sequenced general education coursework, major-specific core courses and built-in academic and career planning through IECC’s First-Year Experience sequence.  Students complete a full associate degree designed for transfer in four semesters.\n“Completing those first two years with a clear plan also has a significant financial impact,” said Dr. Ryan Gower, IECC Chancellor.  “At IECC, a student can complete two years of college for about $13,400 in tuition, fees and books.  At the University of Illinois, those same two years can exceed $62,000 when housing and meals are included.  That is more than $48,000 saved by starting your education at one of our four campuses.  Transfer Pathways make IECC the smart and affordable starting point for students planning to earn a four-year degree.”\nThe Transfer Pathways initiative is part of IECC’s broader commitment to Guided Pathways, a student-centered approach that organizes programs into clear academic and career routes, strengthens advising and helps students complete degrees on time.\nFor students and families, the impact is straightforward; fewer unnecessary credits, lower total cost of earning a bachelor’s degree, stronger advising support, and a clear academic plan from the first semester to transfer.\nIECC will begin recruiting students into the new Transfer Pathways programs during the current admission cycle for Fall 2026 enrollment.\nAdditional information, including detailed degree maps for each pathway, will be available on the IECC website in the coming months.",

A panel of producers from different areas of Illinois discussed production practices and fielded questions from those attending about topics, like the current drought &amp; increasing yields. New Wheat Association leadership was elected with Trace Heuerman of Effingham County to serve as president with vice-president John Ernst of Madison County, secretary Nick Frederking of Washington County, and treasurer Nick Pingsterhaus of Clinton County.

        "full_story": "Clay County has been issued a final property assessment equalization factor of 1.0000, according to David Harris, director of the Illinois Department of Revenue (IDOR).\nThe property assessment equalization factor, often called the “multiplier,” is the method used to achieve uniform property assessments among counties, as required by law.  This equalization is particularly important because some of the state’s 6,600 local taxing districts overlap into two or more counties.  If there was no equalization among counties, substantial inequities among taxpayers with comparable properties would result.\nUnder a law passed in 1975, property in Illinois should be assessed at one-third (1/3) of its market value.  Farm property is assessed differently with farm homesites and dwellings subject to regular assessing and equalization procedures.  Farmland is assessed at one-third of its agriculture economic value and not subject to the state equalization factor.\nAssessments in Clay County are at 33.33% of market value, based on sales of properties in 2022, 2023, and 2024.\nThe equalization factor currently being assigned is for 2025 taxes, payable in 2026.\nLast year’s equalization factor for the county was also 1.0000.\nThe final assessment equalization factor was issued after a public hearing on the tentative factor.\nThe equalization factor is determined annually for each county by comparing the price of individual properties sold over the past three years to the assessed value placed on those properties by the county supervisor of assessments/county assessor.\nIf the three-year average level of assessment is one-third of the market value, the equalization factor will be one (1).  If the average level of assessment is greater than one-third of market value, the equalization factor will be less than one (1).  And if the average level of assessment is less than one-third of market value, the equalization factor will be greater than one (1).\nA change in the equalization factor does not mean total property tax bills will increase or decrease.  Tax bills are determined by local taxing bodies when they request money each year to provide services to local citizens.  If the amount requested by local taxing districts is not greater than the amount received in the previous year, then total property taxes will not increase even if assessments increase.\nThe assessed value of an individual property determines what portion of the tax burden a specific taxpayer will assume.  That individual’s portion of tax responsibility is not changed by the multiplier.",

        "full_story": "ILLINOIS RIFL ACT\n(1/26/26)\nAs Illinois lawmakers convene for the 2026 legislative session, House Bill 3320, Responsibility in Firearm Legislation Act, is quickly emerging as one of Governor JB Pritzker’s most controversial gun-control proposals, drawing sharp criticism from gun-rights advocates and strong support from Democratic lawmakers focused on gun violence prevention.\nHouse Bill 3320 would require firearm manufacturers operating in Illinois to obtain a new state permit and pay fees tied to the estimated cost of gun violence.\nAaron Dorr of the Illinois Firearms Association in a recent video said Pritzker’s RIFL Act is probably the most dangerous gun control bill Illinoisans have ever seen, and it already has 35 co-sponsors.\n“For the first year of implementation, these commies have set the total cost of so-called ‘gun violence’ at $866 million.  In other words, the more popular a gun manufacturer is, the more guns they sell, the more they get shaken down by the state of Illinois.  This is straight-up economic warfare against firearms manufacturers, designed to drive them out of the state,” said Dorr.\nSupporters of the bill argue it is a response to the financial burden gun violence places on taxpayers.  State Senator Robert Peters, a Chicago Democrat and longtime gun-control advocate, said Illinois residents are already paying the price for firearm-related injuries and deaths.\n“Illinois taxpayers pay billions for gun injuries each year, from hospital bills to emergency response, lost wages to rehabilitation,” Peters said.  “With the RIFL Act, we are demanding the firearm manufacturing industry share in these public costs with us.”\nThe legislation would create a new state permit for firearm manufacturers operating in Illinois.  Under the proposal, manufacturers would be charged annual licensing fees based on their market share and the state’s estimated cost of gun violence.\nPeters said federal protections have long shielded manufacturers from financial accountability.\n“Since the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, firearm manufacturers have been shielded from lawsuits and the consequences of their for-profit activity, leaving taxpayers to effectively subsidize the negative effects of the firearm industry.  The RIFL Act aims to fund survivors and community violence intervention,” Peters said.  “It shifts costs from working-class families to an industry that profits an estimated $20 billion a year.”\nUnder HB 3320, funds collected from manufacturers would be used to compensate individuals defined as victims of firearm injuries.  Eligible expenses include medical care, mental health services, lost wages, relocation costs and funeral expenses.\nCritics argue the bill’s definition of “victim” is overly broad. Dorr warned that the language does not distinguish between innocent victims and individuals injured while committing crimes.\n“There’s no carve-out that says they have to be the victim of a crime,” Dorr said.  “A person shot while committing a robbery could be treated as a victim under this act.”\nThe bill also includes penalties for noncompliance.  Manufacturers who violate the act could face civil fines of up to $1 million per month, while firearm retailers could be fined $10,000 per violation for selling products from unpermitted manufacturers.\nDorr said those penalties are intended to dismantle the firearms industry in Illinois.\n“That’s designed to collapse the entire firearms supply chain in Illinois,” Dorr said.  “Manufacturers, dealers, and ultimately gun owners are all targets.”\nAlthough HB 3320 did not receive a vote last session, its growing list of co-sponsors has raised concerns among opponents that the measure could advance this year.",

        "image": "https://www.wnoi.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/E15-resized.webp",
        "full_story": "The State of Illinois is again calling on the United States Congress and the Trump administration to require year-round sales of E15 fuel.  Earlier this year, Governor JB Pritzker sent a letter to Congressional leadership on November 4, 2025, urging nationwide, year-round E15.\n“Agriculture is the number one industry in Illinois.  Our farmers feed the world, and they have the potential to fuel it as well.  As Trump’s tariffs hurt farmers nationwide and rising costs put strain on American families, Congress must require permanent, year-round E15, said Governor JB Pritzker.  “E15 enhances our nation’s energy supply, helps the economy, and supports a cleaner environment all at once.  Year-round E15 is not optional — it’s essential.  That’s why I was the first Governor in the corn belt to sound the alarm for Congress in November.  I once again urge the federal government to act in favor of our farmers and the environment.”\nUnder current law, E15 access during the summer driving season has relied on temporary emergency waivers.  These stopgap measures provide only brief relief and fall short of a stable, long-term solution.\nIllinois is the second largest producer of corn in the nation.  With corn production at record highs – the USDA crop estimate puts corn crop estimates above 17 billion bushels for the first time, up from 14.9 billion bushels in 2024 – the surplus inventory drives prices down, hurting farmers already struggling to break even amid rising input costs.  Corn prices hit the lowest price since August after the USDA made its announcement.\nA year-round requirement for E15 would increase demand for corn by 2 billion bushels a year, according to a new report from the Renewable Fuels Association.\nWhile ethanol use supports jobs, lowers fuel costs and reduces emissions, federal regulations continue to block E15 sales during critical summer months, creating unnecessary uncertainty for farmers.\n“Illinois is a national leader in corn and ethanol production. Year-round E15 would keep energy dollars in the Midwest, reduce reliance on foreign oil, and cut harmful emissions without additional cost to taxpayers,” said Jerry Costello II, Director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.\nAllowing nationwide, year-round use of American ethanol is a practical solution that strengthens the energy supply, reduces costs for consumers, and provides the long-term certainty that Illinois farmers deserve.\n“Illinois farmers cannot afford to do business.  The best solution is a stronger economy,” said US Senator Dick Durbin.  “First, the President must stop these trade wars that are damaging our top farm export markets.  Second, Congress must pass permanent E15, which will immediately help farm families, while cutting the cost of gasoline for everyone by up to 30 cents a gallon.  As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I will fight to get E15 finished now.”\n“Illinois farmers are the backbone of our economy and the stewards of America’s food and fuel supply.  Year-round E15 isn’t just an agricultural issue; it’s an economic, environmental, and national security imperative.  By adopting a permanent, nationwide E15 standard, we can lower costs for families, strengthen rural communities, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  Congress must deliver the certainty our farmers and consumers deserve,” said Rep. Jonathan Jackson.\n“I have been fighting in Congress for several years to secure year-round, nationwide access to E-15, including cosponsoring the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act,” said Rep. Robin Kelly.  “While temporary waivers for midwestern states have helped maintain the ethanol industry, it is past time to allow the sale of year-round E-15 across the country.  At a time when affordability is top of mind for Illinoisans, homegrown biofuels will lower fuel prices, reduce emissions, and provide support for our farmers as they navigate President Trump’s challenging tariffs.”\n“Illinois farmers are producing more than ever, but Washington’s stop-and-go approach to E15 keeps holding them back,” said Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi.  “Making E15 available year-round would strengthen our energy supply, lower costs at the pump, and provide the certainty corn growers need to stay competitive.  It’s a practical, pro-farmer solution—and it’s time for federal action.”\n“I have long been a strong advocate for year-round E15, having seen firsthand the benefits it delivers to consumers at the pump and to the farmers in my district,” said Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski.  “As co-chair of the Biofuels Caucus in Congress, I will continue leading the charge for federal legislation that provides a permanent solution and long-term certainty for our growers.”\n“Year-round E15 is a win for Illinois farmers and for families feeling the pinch at the pump.  It creates steady demand for our corn, supports rural jobs, and gives drivers a cleaner, more affordable fuel choice,” said Congressman Eric Sorensen.  “Congress and the administration need to act so producers and consumers can count on certainty, not short-term fixes.”",

        "full_story": "1/19/26\nNew postal service changes to postmarking and transportation rules could disrupt mail-in voting in the 2026 election, Illinois county clerks warn.\nAhead of the March primary election, county clerks are telling voters not to rely on past processes and to mail their ballots as early as possible, no later than one week before Election Day.\nClerks from around the state discussed how to educate voters at the annual Illinois Association of County Clerks and Recorders Conference on Thursday in East Peoria.\nOne new rule, which took effect December 24\nth\n, states that the date a postmark is applied to a piece of mail may not reflect the day it was received by the Postal Service.\nCurrently, 14 states, including Illinois, will accept mail-in ballots if they are received within a certain period after Election Day if they are postmarked on or before Election Day.\nClerks warned that uncertainty about when ballots will now be postmarked necessitates voters to act earlier.  The way postmarks are applied is not changing, the USPS says.  Mail is only postmarked at distribution centers, and that will remain the same.\nBut in an effort to improve mail delivery efficiency, some localities’ mail may be sent to a different distribution center than in the past, which can increase the amount of time it takes for the USPS to receive and then postmark mail at these centers.\n“It’s a question mark of when will it actually get through a distribution center.  So I’m advising my voters to make sure that they get their vote-by-mail ballot in the mail no less than a week before Election Day,” John Ackerman, the Tazewell County clerk, said.\nVoters can also request a manual postmark from their local post office or drop off their ballot at the election official’s office.\nBut if election officials can’t rely on postmarks to reflect accurate dates, a number of mail-in ballots that were mailed prior to Election Day may not be counted at all clerks said.\nBallots also will no longer be automatically considered priority mail, increasing the amount of time it will take to deliver the mail.\nThese changes will be most felt during the recount process, when candidates are “scrambling,” Ackerman said.\nThe clerks generally agreed this could change the outcome of a race.\nClerks also said they are concerned about changes impacting voter trust in elections, especially because voter guidance is now going to be different depending on the county’s location and distribution center.\nIn the past, when this potential change was proposed, the clerks said they were able to speak to federal lawmakers to advocate for its reversal.\nIn late September 2025, a delegation of clerks traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with lawmakers and staff about changes to federal funding for election infrastructure and learned lawmakers didn’t know about the potential changes, Ackerman said.\n“They were all unaware that this change was going to take effect.  They were unaware, in my opinion, of the impacts it would have on vote by mail,” he said.\nThis time, however, clerks didn’t know the changes were proposed until days before they were implemented.\nTo be sure your vote has been counted, voters can call their county clerk’s office, or some counties offer ballot tracking online.\nCounty clerks emphasized that voting by mail is still safe and secure, but it might take more work and planning.",

Mitch McConnell of Kentucky announced the Senate's passage of a federal funding bill that secures more than $540 million for Kentucky priorities. The bill, which focuses on areas such as Commerce-Justice-Science, Interior-Environment, and Energy-Water, now awaits President Trump's signature.\nThe funding includes $70 million for the University of Louisville's Center for Bioscience and $35 million for the University of Kentucky's Healthy Kentucky Research Building No. 2. \"This federal funding is an important investment in research infrastructure at UofL and UK,\" McConnell said.\nThe bill allocates $2.5 million for a new cybercrime training facility in Madisonville and $352,000 for law enforcement equipment in Warren County. \"These federal investments will equip Kentucky's law enforcement with the tools and training they need to keep our communities safe,\" McConnell said.\nAdditionally, $340 million is set aside for environmental remediation at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. \"These federal investments deliver long-overdue cleanup at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant while positioning the site for the future,\" McConnell said.\nThe funding also includes $21.281 million for the Rough River Dam Safety Modification Project and $600,000 for an erosion study at Columbus-Belmont State Park. Investments in water infrastructure, such as $9.256 million for a water treatment plant in Edmonson County, are also part of the package. \"These critical federal investments in water and wastewater infrastructure will protect public health and ensure Kentucky communities can continue to grow,\" McConnell said.\nThe bill supports recreational areas with $7.45 million for Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area and $1 million for improvements at Green River National Wildlife Refuge. \"Investing in Land Between the Lakes and the Green River National Wildlife Refuge strengthens Kentucky's outdoor recreation and tourism opportunities,\" McConnell said.\nOther priorities include $10.5 million in funding for invasive carp management in the lower Mississippi River Basin, funding for economic development initiatives, and for law enforcement support.

        "full_story": "(1/16/26) pg\nThe Clay City School Board met Thursday night in the district library and made quick work of a light agenda, but it did include a brief discussion about the topic of alternative school.\nBoard President Misty Lindeman called the meeting to order, and the roll was called with all members present.  The board approved the agenda and past meeting minutes.\nSuperintendent John Neubaum presented the Financial Report and noted that finances were pretty stable, except for an HVAC issue at the end of the year that cost the district around $15,000 to fix.  He also mentioned that the ISBE budget is being reduced and that will translate to belt tightening at schools across the state.  A motion was made to approve the financial report, and it was approved unanimously.\nIn informational items, Supt. Neubaum said there are 211 students enrolled at Clay City Schools.  He moved on to briefly comment on the Illinois School Report Card.  He said the state had changed how districts are rated in some regard.  Some schools that had achieved commendable status are now listed as not commendable and the change of descriptions was causing angst around the state.  Neubaum said ISBE normally just plows ahead despite concerns.  But this time they are conducting a listening tour to better understand the districts issues with the new system of ratings.  Supt. Neubaum also discussed the continuing issues with FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) Requests.  He says the district received a request from a law firm that specializes in suing Illinois school districts that redact names from documents.  He said the district’s law firm suggested that they deal with that particular FOIA request.\nPrincipal Brian Wattles presented the student activity update.  He noted Pre-K students are preparing to hatch chickens in their hands on science experience.  Kindergarten students were preparing for the 100\nth\nday of School on January 27 and learning about the impact of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  First grade students focused on their goal of earning 240 good grades and are earning a trip to The Scoop on Main for ice cream and studying about the legacy of Martin Lutrher King Jr.  Third grade students are working on division in math and reading both picture books and chapter books. Fourth graders are taking a new approach on Accelerated Reader assignments and look two complete two AR tests each week.  Sixth grade students are learning about Mediterranean Countries while seventh grade students are studying the founding of the 13 Original Colonies.  And eight graders are examining the differences between the North and South during the Industrial Revolution.  They also learned about sending professional emails.  Jr. high literature classes focused on non-fiction books.  At the high school, students completed CPR training and numerous students were recognized for their dedication and hard work.  Student Molly Lindeman was also recognized for performing the National Anthem at last weeks’ Clay City vs. North Clay basketball game.  Basketball Players, Cheerleaders and band members were also recognized.\nIn New Business, the board approved strategic goals that were set for the new calendar year submitted by a committee of teachers, board members and district staff.  Supt. Neubaum lead the board through a discussion of the School Maintenance Grant Project through Veregy.  He stated that next year the grant will become a competitive process that could work in the district’s favor.  He said Clay City Schools are in the process of updating the HVAC system around the various buildings.  Since the program appears to favor projects completed in stages, Clay City will likely seek to install the HVAC systems in multiple years and the motion was approved.\nSupt Neubaum told the board about a proposal to create a school within a school alternative program.  He explained the district has a small handful of jr. high level students that have fallen behind due to a combination of behavioral and attendance issues.  By creating an alternative school at Clay City, it is hoped that the students can succeed at academic recovery to catch up to what they’ve missed and then move forward and return to regular classes.  This intervention will remove the students from the general student population, and they will have no socialization with other students, except on the way to school and back home.  The students must agree to attend this version of alternative school.  Board members questioned this approach and had other concerns as well.  With encouragement from the supt., members  but did vote unanimously to approve the measure through the end of the current school year.  Supt. Neubaum will update the board about the situation in a month, and the board could agree to continue the program or eliminate it based on what the progress report shows.\nThe final agenda item was a request to approve the retirement of Kindergarten Teacher Beth Yates, effective at the end of the 2028/29 school year.  The board approved the request unanimously.\nClay City Senior Camden Bruner addressed the board on behalf of the Class of 2026.  He asked the board to approve the Senior Class Trip to Orange Beach, Alabama March 12-15 and discussed their fundraising efforts.  After answering a few questions, the board approved his request without dissent.\nAnd with all business complete, the meeting adjourned.",

Investigators found that part broken into two pieces after the UPS crash, and the lugs that held that part were cracked.\nPhotos released by the NTSB of the Nov. 4 crash show flames erupting as the rear of the engine starting to detach before it flew up and over the wing. Then the wing was engulfed by fire as the burning engine flew above it.\non the plane that was headed for Hawaii were killed along with\non the ground near Louisville's Muhammad Ali International Airport.\nThe factual report released Wednesday doesn’t state what caused the engine to fly off. That conclusion won't come until the NTSB's final report, which usually doesn't come until more than a year after a crash.\nBoeing, UPS and the Federal Aviation Administration are limited on what they can say while the NTSB investigation is ongoing.\nUPS spokesperson Jim Mayer reiterated that the company was devastated by the crash. “We remain profoundly saddened by the Flight 2976 accident. Our thoughts continue to be with the families and Louisville community who are grieving, and we remain focused on the recovery effort,” Mayer said.\nThe NTSB previously said investigators\nin some of the parts that held the engine to the wing. Those cracks hadn't been caught in regular maintenance done on the plane, which raised questions about the adequacy of the maintenance schedule. The last time those key engine mount parts were examined closely was in October 2021, and the plane wasn't due for another detailed inspection for roughly 7,000 more takeoffs and landings.\nThe 34-year-old MD-11 plane only got 30 feet (9.1 meters) off the ground before crashing into several industrial buildings just past the runway and generating a massive fireball that could be\n. Dramatic videos of the crash showed the plane on fire as it plowed into buildings and released a massive plume of smoke.\nAirlines quit flying this type of plane commercially years ago because it isn't as efficient as newer models, but they had continued to fly for cargo carriers like UPS and FedEx and a few of these planes were also modified for use in firefighting. All the MD-11s that had been in use and 10 related DC-10s have been\n.\nIt's not clear when the cracks started to develop in the engine mounting pylon parts, but this crash is reminiscent of a 1979 crash in Chicago when the left engine flew off an American Airlines DC-10 during takeoff, killing 273 people. The DC-10 was the predecessor of the MD-11.\nThat previous crash led to the worldwide grounding of 274 DC-10s. The airline workhorse was allowed to return to the skies because the NTSB determined that maintenance workers damaged the plane that crashed while improperly using a forklift to reattach the engine. That meant the crash wasn’t caused by a fatal design flaw even though there had already been a number of accidents involving DC-10s.\nCopyright 2026 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
