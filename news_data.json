Investigators found that part broken into two pieces after the UPS crash, and the lugs that held that part were cracked.\nPhotos released by the NTSB of the Nov. 4 crash show flames erupting as the rear of the engine starting to detach before it flew up and over the wing. Then the wing was engulfed by fire as the burning engine flew above it.\non the plane that was headed for Hawaii were killed along with\non the ground near Louisville's Muhammad Ali International Airport.\nThe factual report released Wednesday doesn’t state what caused the engine to fly off. That conclusion won't come until the NTSB's final report, which usually doesn't come until more than a year after a crash.\nBoeing, UPS and the Federal Aviation Administration are limited on what they can say while the NTSB investigation is ongoing.\nUPS spokesperson Jim Mayer reiterated that the company was devastated by the crash. “We remain profoundly saddened by the Flight 2976 accident. Our thoughts continue to be with the families and Louisville community who are grieving, and we remain focused on the recovery effort,” Mayer said.\nThe NTSB previously said investigators\nin some of the parts that held the engine to the wing. Those cracks hadn't been caught in regular maintenance done on the plane, which raised questions about the adequacy of the maintenance schedule. The last time those key engine mount parts were examined closely was in October 2021, and the plane wasn't due for another detailed inspection for roughly 7,000 more takeoffs and landings.\nThe 34-year-old MD-11 plane only got 30 feet (9.1 meters) off the ground before crashing into several industrial buildings just past the runway and generating a massive fireball that could be\n. Dramatic videos of the crash showed the plane on fire as it plowed into buildings and released a massive plume of smoke.\nAirlines quit flying this type of plane commercially years ago because it isn't as efficient as newer models, but they had continued to fly for cargo carriers like UPS and FedEx and a few of these planes were also modified for use in firefighting. All the MD-11s that had been in use and 10 related DC-10s have been\n.\nIt's not clear when the cracks started to develop in the engine mounting pylon parts, but this crash is reminiscent of a 1979 crash in Chicago when the left engine flew off an American Airlines DC-10 during takeoff, killing 273 people. The DC-10 was the predecessor of the MD-11.\nThat previous crash led to the worldwide grounding of 274 DC-10s. The airline workhorse was allowed to return to the skies because the NTSB determined that maintenance workers damaged the plane that crashed while improperly using a forklift to reattach the engine. That meant the crash wasn’t caused by a fatal design flaw even though there had already been a number of accidents involving DC-10s.\nCopyright 2026 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
