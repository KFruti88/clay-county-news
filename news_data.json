        "full_story": "1/7/25\nBy Beth Fancher\nClay City village trustees met last night, dealing with a continuing employee benefits matter that has been under discussion for several months.  Board members expressed concern regarding the disparity in benefits provided to office personnel compared to other village employees.  Village trustees unanimously voted for all village employees to receive a five percent pay increase, though discussions about work hours with Village Attorney Barry Bright became heated.  Trustee Beth Prosser presented these recommendations by Zoom.\nTrustee Sue Lindeman said she was concerned the employes handbook was incorrect and questioned how Attorney Bright and a past mayor had allowed office personnel to work from 8 am to 4 pm and take an hour paid lunch break.  Attorney Bright said they were not given a raise at that time.  Trustee Lindeman asked why this was never voted on by the board and wanted to see this agreement on paper.  Attorney Bright said there was an oral agreement made several years ago, before Shannon Hall was employed by the village.\nTrustees approved an eight-hour workday with no paid lunch for all village employees.  Trustee Travis Strasbaugh voted no.  Strasbaugh later said he was concerned about a lawsuit.\nAfter an explanation on selling village owned property next to the Clay City Fellowship Church, Village President Mike Delonshaw was instructed to present an offer to the church and sell it as surplus property, to avoid legal paperwork and financial costs.\nTrustees approved purchasing a Chlorine Pocket Chlorometer replacing the current one that is not accurate at a cost of, $711.\nThey approved and signed of a lease with GFI (formerly Miller’s) for a new copy machine for $78.03 per month, plus $54.75 for maintenance and toner.  The second cost will only be as needed.\nSheriff Andy Myers presented the December sheriff’s report for the village.  Sheriff Myers said they are dealing with the Safety Act issues.\nHe also talked a little about the new body scan machine and that he is teaching a college credit course for all three schools in criminal justice.  He said last year he had 13 students and said there were 15 or 16 students this semester at Flora High School.",
