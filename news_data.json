Traditional, real Christmas trees can still serve a valuable purpose after the holiday season. \u00a0Because they are biodegradable, these trees can be used for environmental applications such as providing valuable habitats for fish in ponds and lakes or being turned into compost or mulch for erosion control and soil stabilization. This year, any donated trees will be given to the Stephen A. Forbes State Park, where they will be used in the lake to provide cover and nutrients for fish. Christmas trees may be dropped off at the West end of the Clay County Health Department any time before today by the Christmas Tree Collection sign and orange fencing.\u00a0 Remember to remove any ornaments, decorations, and tinsel from your tree before dropping it off, these items are not biodegradable and will cause harm to wildlife. \u00a0A good rule of thumb is to take your tree to the drop-off location in the same condition as you would find it naturally in the forest.
