        "full_story": "1/2/26\nIllinois\u2019 statewide 1% grocery tax went away yesterday, although many people continue to pay it at the local level.\nData compiled by the Illinois Municipal League shows that 656 municipalities, a little more than half of the state\u2019s municipalities, have passed an ordinance establishing their own grocery tax. \u00a0Those communities are home to 7.2 million people, or 56.5% of the state\u2019s population. \u00a0Three counties, Washington, Wabash and Moultrie have also approved countywide grocery taxes.\u00a0 In Clay County, Flora, Louisville and Clay City have all passed a 1% grocery tax.\nGovernor JB Pritzker signed a bill in 2024 eliminating the 1% statewide grocery tax, which he touted as a measure to ease residents\u2019 tax burden. \u00a0But because the revenue from the state grocery tax went to municipal governments, rather than state coffers, the measure allowed local governments to levy their own 1% tax via ordinance, rather than a referendum to voters.",
